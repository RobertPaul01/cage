# Sprite Base
I created this sprite base so I can write the CAGE tiled
tutorial and possibly use it for my next game as well.

I am open-sourcing for anyone to use and customize freely as
public domain.

If you do happen to use it for a commercial project, I will
be happy to know my work was useful :)

Sharing sprites or accessories generated using this sprite
base is encouraged for the greater good of the indie games
development community.
